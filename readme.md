# Usesful scripts to calibrate tipping Bucket Rain Gauges
By Ryan Cole for FEWS Lab at OSU College of Forestry

## About
testing-tipping-bucket.ino -> Tests the switch in a tipping bucket still works properly by blinking an LED when the tip happens.
event-logger.ino -> Logs tips and prints to the serial monitor

## TODO
Make a program that takes input of tip size and calculates the amount of precip. Can use this plus a rain gauge calibrator to test calibration of a rain gauge
